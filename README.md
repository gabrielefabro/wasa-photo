## How to build

If you're not using the WebUI, or if you don't want to embed the WebUI into the final executable, then:

```shell
go build ./cmd/webapi/
```

If you're using the WebUI and you want to embed it into the final executable:

```shell
./open-npm.sh
# (here you're inside the NPM container)
npm run build-embed
exit
# (outside the NPM container)
go build -tags webui ./cmd/webapi/
```

## How to run (in development mode)

You can launch the backend only using:

```shell
go run ./cmd/webapi/
```

If you want to launch the WebUI, open a new tab and launch:

```shell
./open-npm.sh
# (here you're inside the NPM container)
npm run dev
```

## Known issues

### Apple M1 / ARM: `failed to load config from`...

If you use Apple M1/M2 hardware, or other ARM CPUs, you may encounter an error message saying that `esbuild` (or some other tool) has been built for another platform.

If so, you can fix issuing these commands **only the first time**:

```shell
./open-npm.sh
# (here you're inside the NPM container)
npm install
exit
# Now you can continue as indicated in "How to build/run"
```

**Use these instructions only if you get an error. Do not use it if your build is OK**.
